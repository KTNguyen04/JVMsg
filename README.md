## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `target`: the folder to maintain compiled output
- `pom.xml`: the Maven project object model file that contains the configuration for the Maven build process

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `target` folder by default.
